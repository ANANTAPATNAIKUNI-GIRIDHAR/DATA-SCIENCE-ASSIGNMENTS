    "Ans) In Python, tuples are data structures that resemble lists, but they differ significantly in that tuples cannot be changed, while lists may. \n",
    "The following are some traits of tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered: Tuples preserve the order in which elements are placed into them, just like lists do. A tuple's elements can be accessed using its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Once a tuple is formed, its contents cannot be altered. A tuple cannot have elements added, removed, or changed. Tuples are useful for \n",
    "            storing data that shouldn't be inadvertently altered because of their immutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Elements of tuples may be of various data types, such as strings, numbers, lists, or even other tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterable: Just like with lists, you can iterate over a tuple's elements using a comprehension or loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed: You can access elements of a tuple using their index positions, similar to lists. The indexing starts from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples are hashable, which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory efficient: Tuples consume less memory compared to lists because tuples are immutable, and Python can optimize memory allocation for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, tuples are immutable sequences of elements, ordered and indexed, making them suitable for situations where you need to store a fixed collection of items that should not change."

    "In Python, tuples have two built-in methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **count()**: This method returns the number of occurrences of a specified value in the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",

The limited number of methods simplifies the tuple's interface, keeping it lean and focused on its primary purpose of storing immutable sequences of elements.\n",

Lists support operations such as appending, inserting, removing, and modifying elements, so they have methods to facilitate these operations. Therefore, lists have a richer set of built-in methods to accommodate their mutable nature and the operations commonly performed on them."

    "Ans) A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is used to store data in the form of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and associated with a corresponding value. Dictionaries are often used when you need to store and retrieve data quickly based on a unique identifier (the key).\n",

    "\n",
    "A dictionary is an unordered collection, which means the order of items is not preserved. In Python versions prior to 3.7, dictionaries were unordered, meaning the order in which items were inserted was not maintained. However, starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the insertion order of their items, which means they are now effectively ordered. So, while dictionaries are ordered in recent Python versions, it's essential to note that this behavior is implementation-dependent and was officially guaranteed only from Python 3.7 onwards. For practical purposes, you can consider dictionaries to be ordered in Python 3.7 and later."
